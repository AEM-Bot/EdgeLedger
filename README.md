# EdgeLedger

This is a fictional Financial Institution developed using HTML, CSS3 using flexbox (reusable flex box css) and very light javascript

This is more like creating the own framework for css not using any frameworks like bootstrap but follows the bootstrap concepts and media queries

For Lightbox effect, this project uses lighbox 2 plugin/library.
